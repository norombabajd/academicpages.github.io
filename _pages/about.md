Hello, I'm John Daniel Norombaba. I am a student who wants to make the high-school experience fun, while we all try to manage academics at the same time. I strongly believe and commit to being a leader and serving others before myself. To me, being a leader includes holding values like honesty, responsibility, integrity, and accountability. My journey is only getting started, so I welcome you to follow along by going to my e-jorunal, studying a Quizlet, or using the follow button to find me on social media.
