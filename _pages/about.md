Hello, welcome to my landing page. I'm John Daniel, a student leader doing his best to create an awesome high school experience, dealing with both local and issues across this nation. I strongly believe and commit to being a leader by serving others before myself. To me, being a leader includes holding values like honesty, responsibility, integrity, and accountability.

As states ease restrictions, and the country begins to slowly open up, please remember: observe social distancing, wear a face covering, and follow [CDC, WH, and state guidelines](https://coronavirus.gov/). I recommend using Apple's [tool](https://apple.com/covid19) if you are looking into self-screening due to their commitment to your privacy, and collaboration with the CDC, FEMA, and the WH. Even if you consider yourself not at risk for COVID-2019, I ask that you be considerate of those at risk, those battling this sickness, and those plagued with the idea that their loved ones may not make it, and the essential-workers who put themselves at risk.

BlackLivesMatter
======

I may never experience this type of injustice in my life, but we should never side with an aggressor, or turn a blind eye to what is happening across this nation. Right now, the #BlackLivesMatter movement has become greater than George Floyd, a movement that targets a system inherently failing the black community. We cannot be distracted when peace is aggregated with violence to negatively portray a movement of change. Change cannot only begin with ourselves, but with the people around us. Recognize the problem, and use your privileges to stand up for the human rights of the black community. Make your voices heard, register to vote, and do what you can to help.
