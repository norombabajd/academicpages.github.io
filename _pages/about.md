To be clear, yes, my first name is John Daniel. Your first instinct may be to call me Daniel, but please call me John. I enjoy working with people, and I would do almost anything for my friends, and I think everyone deserves to have a great time. A lot of people call me funny, but I see it as just awkward. However or whenever we’d meet, your first impressions might be a little off, but I wanted to let you know that behind this crazy is someone more capable at what he does.

# **Technology**

What stands out to many is my interests in technology. I’m no IT specialist, but knowing how to restart a router puts me at the top of everyone’s tech support list. I try to go the extra mile to be informed about how my iPhone works, but compared to the entire industry, I’m just a novice. What made technology stand out to me as a kid was seeing how much it was able to do. Growing up with it, it’s amazing to see how thin and large phones have become since then.

# **Leadership**

My goal as a student of the Titan Family, as your Rally Commissioner, as a Link Crew Leader is to bring our school closer together. One freshman at a time, one laugh at a time, and one story at a time. I devote my time not only for my education and my future, but to my peers, to my teachers, not because I am in a position to do so, but because it is the right thing to do.
