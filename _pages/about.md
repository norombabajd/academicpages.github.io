Welcome!
======
I'm John Daniel, a student leader doing his best to create an awesome high school experience, while growing and learning more about the issues we currently face. As an ASB Rally Commissioner, I organize a budget, create and schedule games and events, and announce and recognize academic and athletic achievement at rallies. However, my strive to help goes beyond my position, as I also deliver help with technology, videography, and other campus related activities.

Leadership Objectives:
======
1. To deliver an enhanced campus experience for students and teachers through spirit.
2. To deliver outstanding and unconditional service by placing others before myself.
3. To streamline the rally planning process through comprehensive organization and planning.
4. To uphold values like honesty, responsibility, integrity, and accountability.

#COVID-19
======
As states and counties ease restrictions, and COVID cases continue to grow in the United States, observe social distancing, wear a face covering, and follow [CDC, WH, and state guidelines](https://coronavirus.gov/). If you feel sick, stay at home, contact your medical provider.

#BlackLivesMatter
======
Racial injustice continues to be a pressing issue in the United States, evident in the founding of this country. Use your privileges to stand up for the human rights of the black community. Make your voices heard, register to vote, and do what you can to help.

#PrayForLebanon

Lebanon already is facing an [enormous crisis](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDfrFlqhQVf/), and now has to deal with the aftermath of the horrifying explosion in Beirut. Do what you can to help and to elevate the voices of change.
