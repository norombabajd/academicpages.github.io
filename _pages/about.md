Hello, I'm John Daniel. A teenager getting through life. A lot of people say I'm funny, I just call that being awkward. I really enjoy technology, have a small thing for planes and traveling, and am very interested in a future in engineering. I wrestle through software and design architecture, and I continue to think about where my future may lead me.

Introduction
======
I would consider myself as a hospitable person. If you invited me to a party, people might think I was the party host. I love being around people, and making sure that everyone is having a good time. In many situations, I want there to be fun, excitement, and anything but boring. I will always be devoted to positivity, and the beliefs of inclusion and equality. I try to be a perfectionist and minimalist, believe me, I do my best! Too many, the first impressions of me are definitely something. You'd think I'm crazy and weird. But I hope you can trust me when I say, I am definitely more.

Education
======
Currently in eleventh grade, I am very much proud to be a Titan. I love showing my spirit, and as the ASB Rally Commissioner, I also love spreading it. Also a Link Crew Leader, I very much want to make sure freshman transition into high school as smoothly, and as fun as I can make it. I really do enjoy getting involved to make sure that the campus experience is nothing more than exceptional. I create [Quizlets](https://quizlet.com/johndaniel_) not only for myself, but to help other students out when it comes to subjects like our vocabulary lists in English. School to me is not only academics, but a wonderful place to meet new people. I enjoy working with other students to help out with rallies, and other activities like orientation. I believe strongly that success in academics can only be reached through hard work, studying, and effort.

My four year path in high school is focused on the PLTW or [Project Lead the Way](https://www.pltw.org/about-us) program at my school. I plan on taking four years of Spanish alongside the PLTW/STEM program. I very much enjoy writing, and analyzing content. Interpreting art, finding the deeper meanings, is something that interests me in school.

I am apart of Engineering Club and S.K.I.L.L. (Society of Knowledge and Iteration of a Love for Learning) Club. Along with the four years of language, I participate in MeChA and Spanish Honors Society. I have joined the JV Tennis Team for the 2018-2019 school year, and overall have continued to only contribute and participate in my school.
