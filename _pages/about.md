To be clear, yes, my first name is John Daniel. Your first instinct may be to call me Daniel, but please call me John. I enjoy working with people, and I would do almost anything for my friends, and I think everyone deserves to have a great time. A lot of people call me funny, but I see it as just awkward. However or whenever we’d meet, your first impressions might be a little off, but I wanted to let you know that behind this crazy is someone more capable at what he does.

# **Technology**

What stands out to many is my interests in technology. I’m no IT specialist, but knowing how to restart a router puts me at the top of everyone’s tech support list. I try to go the extra mile to be informed about how my iPhone works, but compared to the entire industry, I’m just a novice. What made technology stand out to me as a kid was seeing how much it was able to do. Growing up with it, it’s amazing to see how thin and large phones have become since then.

# **Education**

I am now a junior in high school. Through all the changes and adapting to Common Core, seeing whiteboards turn digital, and old school projectors become a thing of the past, one thing doesn’t change. I love my school, and I love learning. I enjoy the challenge, and through studying and effort, I believe that I am capable of changing the world, with my many peers and colleagues with me.

# **Leadership**

I’ll be honest and say that I never considered myself a leader, and yet being the disorientated one in the bleachers, and being apart of the group that only complains, it only felt right that there had to be something done. The only reason I ever considered myself as the best for people was because it was them who believed in me. As the ASB Rally Commissioner, of course I will continue to not only show but share the spirit and energy we all have through unity as a family. And as a member of Link Crew, I want to keep being raw and real. Freshman year is tough, it was for me, and no battle for those freshmen should ever make them feel alone. Leadership has added a new depth to my view on school, as it should never feel like only a place of learning, but a place to grasp new ideas, and to grow skills needed in our lives after.
