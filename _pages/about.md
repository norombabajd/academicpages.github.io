Hello, welcome to my landing page. I'm John Daniel, a student leader doing his best to create an awesome high school experience, dealing with both local and issues across this nation. I strongly believe and commit to being a leader by serving others before myself. To me, being a leader includes holding values like honesty, responsibility, integrity, and accountability.

[BlackLivesMatter](https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co)
======
I may never experience this type of injustice in my life, but we should never side with an aggressor, or turn a blind eye to what is happening across this nation. Right now, the #BlackLivesMatter movement has become greater than George Floyd, a movement that targets a system inherently failing the black community. We cannot be distracted when peace is aggregated with violence to negatively portray a movement of change. Change cannot only begin with ourselves, but with the people around us. Recognize the problem, and use your privileges to stand up for the human rights of the black community. Make your voices heard, register to vote, and do what you can to help. See how you can help by clicking [here](https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co).

Ah yes, my third year of a four year adventure has been completed. In my personal reflection to myself, I not only touched on the past, but look forward to the future.

> The rest of your junior year was clouded with a pandemic, but you always told yourself you wouldn’t have had junior year any other way, and your word remains true. At home, you made AP history by taking your English exam online, and made prom history by not only being the first, and hopefully only ‘Porch-Prom Prince’... What was said was said, and what was done was done. Whatever you couldn’t do this year, I know you’ll only have next year. You always have got this, and with junior year, the ball was in your court. Take senior year, and get a home run. Oh, you never understood sports, let alone yourself.

Junior year was a blast, and I only look forward to what senior year has to offer. ;)

[COVID-2019](https://coronavirus.gov/)
======
As states ease restrictions, and the country begins to slowly open up, please remember: observe social distancing, wear a face covering, and follow [CDC, WH, and state guidelines](https://coronavirus.gov/). I recommend using Apple's [tool](https://apple.com/covid19) if you are looking into self-screening due to their commitment to your privacy, and collaboration with the CDC, FEMA, and the WH. Even if you consider yourself not at risk for COVID-2019, I ask that you be considerate of those at risk, those battling this sickness, and those plagued with the idea that their loved ones may not make it, and the essential-workers who put themselves at risk.
