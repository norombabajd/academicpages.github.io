hello
======
I am John Daniel. I am currently a high school student on an engineering pathway, *but according to my pre-ACT results, I should probably have a plan B ready*. I can't say much about myself other than that I really enjoy being around people, and helping people out. I am devoted to my education, and to keeping a positive environment and *those good vibes*. There may be days where I am down, but seeing everyone around me happy keeps me going.

Currently in development! Hang in there.
